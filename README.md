# CarND_Trafic_Sign_Classifier

## Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

 * Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
 * Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
 * Design, train and test a model architecture
 * Use the model to make predictions on new images
 * Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
 * Summarize the results with a written report
 
 

## Rubric Points

## Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.


### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.
